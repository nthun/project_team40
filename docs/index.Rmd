# Main questions

In this blind analysis, we are going to address 2 research questions:

1) Do religious people report higher well-being? 
2) Does the relation between religiosity and well-being depend on how important people consider religion to be in their country (i.e., perceived cultural norms of religion)?

# Blinded data

The point of blinded data is to let analysts explore the data without the danger of p-hacking. Therefore, only the relationship of the outcomes and predctor variables are destroyed by shuffling, and the remainder is kept intact. 
This means that: 

- Data reduction techinques (PCA, EFA) will yield valid results.
- Outiers, missing data can be observed and treated.
- Confounders can be explored, meaning that not only univariate distributions but correlations are also kept intact.

## Analysis issues to resolve

In order to best address the hypotheses, we need to decide a few things. 

- Operationalization of variables: How should we 
- Outliers (should we exclude them?)
- Choose statistical model ()
  - Confounders
  - Moderators
  - Lumping levels for nominal variables

# Read and process data

```{r}
# Read raw data
marp_raw <- 
  read_csv(here::here("data/MARP_data_blinded.csv"))

marp_proc <-
  marp_raw %>% 
  filter(attention_check == 1) %>% 
  mutate( gender = recode(gender, 
                          "man" = "Male", 
                          "woman" = "Female",
                          "other" = "Other"),
          counry3 = countryname(country, destination = "iso3c"))

```


# Descriptives and potential moderators

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
        select(country, 
               gender, ses, education, ethnicity, denomination,
               sample_type, compensation, 
               ends_with("_mean")) %>% 
        skim()
```

## Demographics by country {.tabset}

### N of participants

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
        mutate(country = fct_infreq(country) %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
        ggplot() +
        aes(y = country) +
        geom_bar() +
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1500, 250)) +
        labs(title = "Number of participants by country",
             y = NULL)

```

### Age

Age has a few obvious outliers (e.g. age of 0 or 1), that we could remove, the sample size makes it unlikely that these outliers have a large influence on the model, therefore I won't remove them.

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, age)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = country, x = age, fill = country) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = .5,
               width = .2,
               outlier.alpha = .2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Age by country",
       y = NULL)


# Number of participants below 18
marp_proc %>% 
  filter(age < 18) %>% 
  nrow()

```


### Gender

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
        group_by(country) %>% 
        summarise(pct_female = mean(gender == "Female", 
                                    na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
        mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, pct_female)) %>%
        ggplot() +
        aes(y = country, x = pct_female) +
        geom_point() +
        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1),
                           labels = scales::percent_format()) +
        labs(title = "Proportion of females by country",
             x = NULL, y = NULL)
```

### Education

Education is a common confounder when the relationship between religiosity and well-being is considered. There is a considerable spread of education within and between countries.

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, education, median)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = country, x = education, fill = country) +
  geom_density_ridges(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Education by country",
       y = NULL, x = NULL)
```

### SES

Socio-economic status is a common confounder when the relationship between religiosity and well-being is considered. There is a considerable spread of SES within and between countries.

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, ses, median)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = country, x = ses, fill = country) +
  geom_density_ridges(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Socio-economic status by country",
       y = NULL, x = NULL)
```

### Denomination

Religious denomination is often used when the connection between religiosity and well being is considered. 

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_infreq(country) %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  count(country, denomination) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = country, x = n, fill = denomination) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Number/Proportion of denominations by country",
       y = NULL,
       fill = "Denomination")
```

However, in its current form, the variable contains categories that are ratther sparse, and this may interfere with the statistical model that we want to use. Therefore we choose to lump together levels that constitute less than 1% of the categories into "Other".

```{r}
lumped_denom <-
  marp_proc %>% 
  transmute(subject, 
            denom_lump = case_when(str_detect(denomination, "Muslim") ~ "Muslim",
                                   str_detect(denomination, "Christian|Evangelical") ~ "Christian",
                                   str_detect(denomination, "Other") ~ "Other",
                                   is.na(denomination) ~ "No denomination",
                                   TRUE ~ denomination) %>% 
                          fct_lump_prop(.01, 
                                        other_level = "Other") %>% 
                          fct_relevel("No denomination"))

marp_proc %>% 
  left_join(lumped_denom, by = "subject") %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_infreq(country) %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  count(country, denom_lump) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = country, x = n, fill = denom_lump, label = denom_lump) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Number/Proportion of denominations by country",
       subtitle = "Denominations that were infrequent (<1%) were lumped together",
       y = NULL,
       fill = "Denomination")

```


### Ethnicity

Well-being might be influenced by ethicity, but not directly. For e.g. minority status might be associated with WB, but there were no questions about this. Therefore, in my opinion, raw ethnicity should not be added to the model.

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(ethnicity = fct_infreq(ethnicity) %>% fct_rev()) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = ethnicity, fill = ethnicity) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(y = NULL)
```


### Importance of religion
```{r}
cnorm_questions <- 
  tibble(name = c("cnorm_1", "cnorm_2"),
         question = c("Importance of religious lifestyle for average person in country",
                      "Importance of belief in God/Gods for average person in country"
                    ))

marp_proc %>% 
  select(subject, country, cnorm_1, cnorm_2) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c("cnorm_1", "cnorm_2")) %>% 
  group_by(country, name) %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(value)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  left_join(cnorm_questions, by = "name") %>%
  mutate(country = reorder_within(country, avg, question)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = avg, y = country) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_reordered(NULL) +
  facet_wrap(~question, ncol = 2, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Normativity of religion by country in two questions")  
  
```


### GDP per capita
```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(gdp = mean(gdp)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, gdp)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = gdp, y = country) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  labs(title = "GDP per capita by country")  


```

### Sample type


```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_infreq(country) %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  count(country, sample_type) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = country, x = n, fill = sample_type) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of sample type by country",
       x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "Sample type")
```

### Compensation

Compensation is 100% associated with the sample type, therefore I'm not going to use it in the model.

```{r}

table(marp_proc$sample_type, marp_proc$compensation, marp_proc$country)

marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_infreq(country) %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  count(country, compensation) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = country, x = n, fill = compensation) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of compensation by country",
       x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "Compensation")
```

# Operationalization of variables {.tabset}

*Religiosity* and *well-being* has multiple items that we can use. According to previous studies of similar topics, *norms about religion* should be aggregated to the country level.

## Religiosity

Although religiosity is an elusive concept, and no one-size-fits-all metric is available. I don't feel competent to choose just one question, so I try to use as much information from all available questions as possible. I'm also not feeling confident to relevel specific questions (e.g. rel_3). Therefore, I choose to use PCA to extract an aggregated variable.

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  select(starts_with("rel_")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~name) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of rel_ variables to be used in PCA")

```

```{r}
# Number of components
marp_proc %>% 
        select(starts_with("rel_")) %>% 
        fa.parallel()

# Parallel analysis suggests to use a single component.
rel_pca <-
        marp_proc %>% 
        select(starts_with("rel_")) %>% 
        pca(nfactors = 1)

# Correlation of religiosity items and the PCA component
marp_proc %>% 
  select(starts_with("rel")) %>% 
  mutate(rel_pca = rel_pca$scores[,1]) %>% 
  cor.plot()

```

The religiosity values seems to vary considerably by country.

```{r}
  marp_proc %>%
  mutate(rel_pca = rel_pca$scores[,1]) %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, rel_pca, median)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = country, x = rel_pca, fill = country) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = .2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Religiosity by country",
       subtitle = "Aggregated religiosity component",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL)
```



```{r}
marp_proc %>%
  bind_cols(rel_pca = rel_pca$scores[,1]) %>% 
  left_join(lumped_denom, by = "subject") %>% 
  mutate(denom_lump = fct_reorder(denom_lump, rel_pca, median)) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(y = denom_lump, x = rel_pca, fill = denom_lump) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .5,
               width = .2,
               outlier.alpha = .2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = .5) +
  labs(title = "Religiosity by denomination",
       subtitle = "Aggregated religiosity component",
       fill = "Denomination",
       x = NULL,
       y = NULL)
```

I compared the PCA operationalization with the self-admitted single item repigiosity. The difference on the country level seems quite subtle.

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(rel_pca = rel_pca$scores[,1]) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(rel_item = mean(rel_3 == 1),
                  rel_pca = mean(rel_pca),
                  n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(across(starts_with("rel_"), ~scale(.x) %>% as.numeric())) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("rel_item", "rel_pca")) %>% 
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country, value)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = value, y = country, color = name) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Different operationalizations of religiosity lead to similar country-wise values (r = .91)",
       subtitle = "One item religiosity (rel_3) vs. 9-item PCA religiosity component (rel_pca) values",
       y = NULL, x = NULL, color = "Operationalization")
```



## Well-being

The well-being questions have calculated values for subscales and overall 

```{r}
marp_proc %>% 
  select(starts_with("wb")) %>% 
  cor.plot()
```

```{r}
# marp_proc %>% 
  
```



## Norms about religiosity into one variable.

Accordint to previous research, norms should be handled on the country level. 
We use the mean of the two variables that are otherwise strongly correlated, since it makes no sense to use a more complicated method (PCA or EFA). Then we calculate the country level mean from this variable.

```{r}
# Country norm of religiosity
country_norms <-
  marp_proc %>% 
  mutate(cnorm_avg = (cnorm_1 + cnorm_2)/2) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(cnorm_mean = mean(cnorm_avg)) %>% 
  ungroup()

```


# Modeling the relationship between religiosity and well-being

## Construct final dataset
```{r}
marp <-
  marp_proc %>% 
  # Add religiosity scores from PCA
  bind_cols(religiosity = rel_pca$scores[,1]) %>%
  # Add country level norms
  left_join(country_norms, by = "country") %>% 
  # Merge different branches of the same religion, lump levels < 1%
  left_join(lumped_denom, by = "subject") 
  
```


## 1) Do religious people report higher well-being? 

```{r}

h1 <- 
  marp %>% 
  filter(country != "Japan") %>% 
  lmer(wb_overall_mean ~ religiosity + 
         # personal level confounders
                         age + gender + ses + education + denom_lump +
         # country and sample level confounders
                         gdp_scaled + sample_type +
         # random intercept and slope model
                         (religiosity|country), data = .)

tab_model(h1)

```

Model diagnostics
```{r}
check_model(h1)
```

It seems like there is a strange 


## 2) Does the relation between religiosity and well-being depend on how important people consider religion to be in their country (i.e., perceived cultural norms of religion)?

```{r}
h2 <- 
  lmer(wb_overall_mean ~ religiosity * cnorm_mean + 
         # personal level confounders
                         age + gender + ses + education + denom_lump +
         # country level confounders
                         gdp_scaled + sample_type + 
         # random intercept and slope model
                         (religiosity|country) ,data = drop_na(marp, age))

summary(h2)
```
